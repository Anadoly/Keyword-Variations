## The Problem

Need to use keywords to capture the online content that is relevant to them. As an example, a telecommunication company in Egypt might use the keywords "Etisalat," "Vodafone," and "Orange'' to obtain conversations about its competitors. Sometimes other conversations are relevant to the client but don't include these keywords; instead, they incorporate a variant (e.g., VodafoneeEgypt, #orange_campaign, etc.) To help our clients, our data science team developed a model that suggests these variants to the clients while authoring their keywords.
